Everybody starts somewhere.

As part of my convoluted, self-taught, web design training labyrinth, I've decided to fool around with a blog built on [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've never really touched [**Markdown**](http://whatismarkdown.com) before either, so this is a two birds, one stone opportunity.

I'm using [Github's Atom editor](http://www.atom.io) and a nifty little plug-in called markdown-writer to edit posts. Admittedly, pretty much all I've done so far is:

- Get jekyll up and running.
- Poke around in the styles.
- Optimize my Atom environment for jekyll/markdown editing.

Right now, I'm really looking forward to digging into the layout design and building a blog all my own. And hosting it on Github pages, which I haven't looked into yet. Of course, if you're reading this, I've already successfully done that...
