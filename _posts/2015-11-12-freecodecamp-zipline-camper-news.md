My latest project for freeCodeCamp is a stylized "camper news" page, using their latest news API to display the latest stories and meet the following requirements:

- **User Story:** As a user, I can browse recent posts from Camper News.
- **User Story:** As a user, I can click on a post to be taken to the story's original URL.
- **Bonus User Story:** As a user, I can see how many upvotes each story has.

First off, I decided to use a flex container for the structure, which turned out really well. I also implemented a CSS animation to show upvotes and a link to the post's page when the user hovers over the item. Check out the codepen and see my work below!
