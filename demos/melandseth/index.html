        <h2>Once upon a time they met online...</h2>

        <p>
          It was June. Seth was just about to delete his online dating profile when he came across an exquisite woman with short hair and an intriguing profile. He figured he had nothing to lose by sending one more girl a message before calling it quits. Mel hadn't logged on for awhile, but got on to check for any new messages one boring afternoon. "Finally," she thought, "this guy doesn't seem like a total weirdo."</p>
          <p>They immediately booked their first date at Logan's Alley and quickly found they had much in common. Their lives fell in together and their love for one another blossomed. They moved through milestones of their relationship with thoughtfulness and care as their love grew stronger with every step.</p>

          <p>
              <img style="border-radius:10%;margin:0 auto" class="img-responsive" width="500px" src="img/ring.png"/><br />Two years later, they decided it was time to take the next step - a big one and went to their favorite jeweler to begin designs for the perfect Lord of the Rings inspired ring. The couple celebrated their engagement with a get-away up north, affectionately dubbed "operation mush". Now these two weirdos are hoping to celebrate with friends and family as they begin their married lives together.</p>

        <h3>Unplugged</h3>
        <p>
          What do we mean by unplugged? During the ceremony, we kindly ask that you keep your cameras, tablets, and smartphones tucked away and leave the photography to our professionals. We'd like our photos to look less like inception - a picture within a picture - and we want you to be present, and sharing in the moment with us. The reception will be plugged in, so feel free at that point to take all the photos you'd like! We promise to post all the photos of our ceremony as soon as we get them! If you're on social media, be sure to use the hashtag #DeHaanAndToHold.

        <p>
          To give all our guests, including parents, the opportunity to let their hair down and have a good time without having to worry about little ones, we've chosen for our wedding day to be an adult only occasion. This will allow for an evening of relaxation for all and we hope this advance notice will allow you to still be able to share in our big day as well as give you an opportunity to let loose and have a fun evening out.
