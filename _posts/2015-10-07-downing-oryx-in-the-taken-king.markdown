Here's a little side track to test embedding Youtube clips with markdown... and shameless higlighting of my jumping skills.

For any of you familiar with Destiny, the latest expansion release, **The Taken King**, offers up a new 6-player raid activity called **King's Fall**. Destiny's raids are easily the most well-developed content in the game, and this one especially requires teamwork, timing, and mostly-flawless execution from all six fireteam members.

The video above highlights the last boss encounter in the raid, and my role involved jumping across a series of platforms my friends generated, so I could snatch up a relic, dunk it like a basketball on an immortal knight and steal his power so we could damage the boss. Definitely not a classic tank n' spank raid encounter.

I've never been into multiplayer games that much, even tend to play most MMOs solo, but I'm having a blast with the group of friends I've found in Destiny. It's really cool to be facing new challenge in a game we've been playing together since last September.
