You can't walk out your front door without tripping over an open world game. You can pick from 100 massive virtual worlds full of NPCs, sidequests, and checklists. What makes one more fun to play over another?

I made the dubious choice to play **Red Dead Redemption 2** and **Assassin's Creed: Odyssey** back to back, in that order. RDR2 is the sequel to a beloved game released in 2010, and ACO is the latest evolution of the Assassin's Creed formula, which saw its last installment (Origins) just over a year ago. Both games were developed by huge teams spanning multiple studios. Both games offer sprawling maps filled with things to do. I probably should have played a shorter palette cleanser before jumping from one into the next, but they play differently enough I haven't really felt any burnout.

I want to talk about the very different design philosophies driving these two games, and my experiences with them, but I think it's important first to establish my history with both franchises and what I enjoy about games.

## My History

I played the first Red Dead Redemption on Xbox 360 soon after it was released. I finished the main story + epilogue and did a lot of the stranger missions. I liked the game and enjoyed my playthrough, but I didn't get as sucked into the world as many others. I wasn't a big fan of the Western aesthetic at the time. I didn't grind out the challenges or do much treasure hunting, and I don't think I even touched the online mode. I thought the story was really strong, and the world and characters were well developed, but the weakness of Rockstar's gunplay mechanics kept me from really falling in love with it.

I've played most of the Assassin's Creed games over the years. I finished the first one and the Ezio trilogy, played III and didn't really like it, loved Black Flag, tried Unity and Syndicate but didn't finish them. Origins was the first one to really click with me since Black Flag, and I really loved the changes they made to the formula. Origins felt more like an Action-RPG than the older games: revamped combat, armor and weapons with stats and perks, and skill trees with more of a sense of progression. It raised my expections for the franchise when I thought it had pretty much run its course.

## Design Philosophy

I can only speak to my personal experience, without totally knowing the developers' motivations, but I think these two games feel so different to play because the developers had different goals:

**RDR2 prioritizes the story and characters, and uses the attachment you form to make you care about the world. ACO prioritizes the world around you, and uses the story and characters to move you through it.**

By no means is this the **only** difference between the games, but I think it might be the most important.

Every moment you spend with the characters in RDR2 draws you further into the world. The character designs are memorable, the voice acting is superb, the story is full of tragedy and comedy, and the animations are so carefully designed it's hard not to feel like you're hanging out with real people. By the end of the game, I had strong feelings about Arthur, all the main characters, and many in the supporting cast. I actually spent time in camp hanging out with the two-dozen gang members because I wanted to have conversations with them, not because I was gaining any kind of progression. I had the same issues many did with the last third of the story: the missions lose their sense of creativity and devolve into a succession of firefights. But the end of the main storyline was still satisfying, and it was rewarding to see the resolutions for these characters I'd formed such strong attachments to.

ACO offers a very different experience. I played as Kassandra, so I don't know if Alexios' story differs at all or how the voice acting compares, but after finishing the story I couldn't tell you much about it. It's the story of a complicated family in the middle of the war between Athens and Sparta. Kassandra's voice acting is charming, and I like her as a character, but by the end of the story I didn't really care what happened to her or any of the other main characters. Not to mention the countless characters delivering sidequests every time you turn around. There are sparks of clever writing and dialogue I enjoyed, but after a dozen hours I found myself mashing the skip button. ACO's core is definitely the world, and it is a beautiful world, chock full of locations and challenges to discover. The story is just a framework to move you to new locations and encourage exploration.

## The Speed of the World

RDR2 and ACO are both open world games, but offer very different experiences. It comes down to **speed.**

In RDR2, everything you do feels slow. If I could describe it in one word, that word would be methodical. You want to skin an animal? Great. It's going to take you ten seconds to skin it. Then, if it's a decent size, you're going to roll up that skin. Now you're going to carry it on over to your horse, and you're going to stow it behind your saddle. You can fit multiple pelts from medium-size animals on your horse, but if you're hunting larger game you're in for a long haul since you can only fit one rolled-up large pelt on your horse's ass at a time.

Everything feels slow because it's all so meticulously animated. If you're looting a dresser, get ready to watch yourself open every drawer individually to see what's inside. Eating the stew at camp means you're going to pick up a bowl, scoop stew into that bowl, eat a few spoonfuls, slurp up the rest, and then discard your bowl. It goes a long way to make the world feel fully realized, but it does require a lot of patience. Even if you're impressed by the level of detail, and I still am, by the time you've spent 100 hours in the world you might not care to watch the full bear skinning animation one more time.

## Parting Thoughts

Walking away from both games, I think I enjoyed my time spent in RDR2's world more. Its world and characters left a bigger impression on me. At the same time, I'm finding it easier to jump back into ACO and knock more things off my checklist in Ancient Greece. The goals I have left to accomplish in RDR2 feel like bigger commitments: hunting down all the legendary animals and fish, completing challenges. They feel like bigger commitments, and since RDR2 moves slower, it's intimidating to think about going after those. I know I can hop back into ACO and hunt down a few more cultists in an hour, and since everything moves faster in that world it feels a lot more achievable.
