Well, after a few days of tinkering I think I've come a long way! Here's a shortlist of what I've accomplished:

- Got this blog up on github pages.
- Purchased a domain ([http://seth-dehaan.com](http://seth-dehaan.com)) and directed it to point here.
- Created pages for tags and post archives. Also filled out my own [About](/about) page, and created en empty 'projects' page to fill.
- Set up a footer with links to social media / contact stuff.
