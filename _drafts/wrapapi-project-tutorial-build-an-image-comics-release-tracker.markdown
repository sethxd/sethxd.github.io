With the right API, you can build an app to solve almost any problem. But what if there's no API available? [WrapAPI](http://www.wrapapi.com) allows you to make your own, and in this tutorial I'll walk you through the first project I built with it.

A few months ago, I had to make a difficult decision: buy more long boxes, or stop buying single issue comics. If you're a comics fan, you know the struggle. For me, especially considering I'll be moving out of state in a few week, it made a lot more sense to cut the cord and stop buying single issues (apologies to all my favorite writers).

Now, I pretty much only read titles from [Image](http://www.imagecomics.com). I'm still a fan, so I want to keep up on my favorite series by picking up the trade paperbacks when they come out. But I follow too many authors to make that a simple task. **The problem: I want the quickest way to see at a glance which trades are coming out on any given week.** The solution? Well, I couldn't find a simple, clean one I really liked. I tried following releases on Amazon or [TFAW](http://www.tfaw.com), or watching release dates on Image's site, but all the methods I tried took too many clicks and didn't put the information I wanted right in front of me.
