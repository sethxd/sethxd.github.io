I've been playing the new God of War and I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't plug the amazing soundtrack.

Bear McCreary absolutely nailed the score on this one. The orchestra provides an epic backdrop to combat even with trash fights, but truly soars during the boss battles. Even the ambient, atmospheric sound while you're exploring the world of Midgard is designed perfectly to immerse you while you're exploring the Norse lands of legend.

Suffice to say, I've been listening to this beast on repeat. I have a ton more of to say about the game, but I think I'll wait until I have some screenshots and/or video to complement my thoughts.

The soundtrack is available to stream on Spotify:
